# Garys Shop

Garys shop is a collection automater tool inspired by the hatred I have for steam not including an "add all" button when adding items to a collection. 

# MASSIVE THANKS

**if you want to get straight to it, go to [How to use](#how-to-use) **

This is only possible because of [kluvo2](https://www.reddit.com/user/kluvo2/). I always go onto their [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/8hrdsd/add_all_subscribed_items_to_steam_collections_at/) and copy and paste that code into the terminal to do the heavy lifting. So I thought, why not move the heavy lifting to an extension!

# How to use

## Installation

You can **either**, git clone the project via ``git clone https://github.com/Barnold8/Garys-Shop`` or by [downloading the project](https://github.com/Barnold8/Garys-Shop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). They both achieve the same results. From here put the extension anywhere on your system deemed suitable. 

Now, you need to go to [the extensions page](chrome://extensions) and click **Developer mode**. From here, three new options will appear. We care about **Load unpacked** for this one. Click that and then select the **Garys shop** folder and now you will have the extension!

### manual

Make or edit a new collection of your choosing and click the extension icon!
