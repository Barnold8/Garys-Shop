# Garys Shop

Garys shop is a collection automater tool inspired by the hatred I have for steam not including an "add all" button when adding items to a collection. 

# MASSIVE THANKS

**if you want to get straight to it, go to [How to use](#how-to-use) **

This is only possible because of [kluvo2](https://www.reddit.com/user/kluvo2/). I always go onto their [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/8hrdsd/add_all_subscribed_items_to_steam_collections_at/) and copy and paste that code into the terminal to do the heavy lifting. So I thought, why not move the heavy lifting to an extension!

# How to use

Make or edit a new collection of your choosing and click the extension icon!


# What did I contribute to this?

* Solved bug in grabbing session cookie, this was extension specific
* Provided more in depth information on how to use tool when encountering it

All of the heavy lifting was again, [kluvo2](https://www.reddit.com/user/kluvo2/)
